      WELCOME....
I have created one Repository for Employee Management
In that Repo i have create entity class, repo , interface, service and controller class.
There are three methods in there.   so now each of you  choose one method and write bussiness logic in serviceImpl and write  api for that perticular method.

Methods are 1) saveEmp
            2) deleteEmp
            3) viewEmp
     Choose  any one method and send msg in wh groop so others can know it. 
     send another message after your task done....

Thanks.....
